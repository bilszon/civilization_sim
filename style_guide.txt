Style guide for filenames, code etc.

1. Filenames:

All filenames and foldernames should be written in snake_case.
There should be no special characters or whitespaces in the names.
All names should be written in English.

2. File structure:

All files containing any code or assets should be placed in the civilization_sim folder.

3. Python code:

Use PEPs, especially PEP8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and PEP257 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)

Use single-quoted strings by default ("foo" instead of ""bar"").
